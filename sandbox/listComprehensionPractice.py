# These are practice problems from chat gpt to work on list comprehensions:

# Squares of Numbers: Given a list of numbers, create a new list that contains the squares of each number in the original list.

test_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Even Numbers: Given a list of numbers, create a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

test_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Words Length: Given a list of words, create a new list that contains the lengths of each word in the original list.

test_3 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

# Uppercase Conversion: Given a list of strings, create a new list that contains the uppercase versions of each string in the original list.

test_4 = ['hello', 'world', 'python']

# Filter by Length: Given a list of words, create a new list that contains only the words with a length greater than a specified value.

test_5 = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'] 
length = 5

# Character Frequency: Given a string, create a dictionary where keys are characters and values are the frequencies of those characters in the string.

test_6 = 'programming'

# Transpose Matrix: Given a matrix (list of lists), create a new matrix that is the transpose of the original matrix.

test_7 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
